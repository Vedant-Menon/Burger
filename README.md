I am making a Burger
What is a burger?
a dish consisting of a flat round cake of minced beef, or sometimes another savoury ingredient, that is fried or grilled and served in a split bun or roll with various condiments and toppings.

Here I have used many vegetables like potatoes, carrots, beans etc nd i have also used breadcrumbs

HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE RECIPE AND HOPE YOU WILL ALSO TRY!!!!!
